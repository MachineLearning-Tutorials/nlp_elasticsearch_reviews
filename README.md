# NLP in Python and ElasticSearch

Conference talk materials for the Dato/Turi data science symposium in SF, July 12-13, 2016.

Three parts:

* Mostly pandas analysis of yelp product reviews in Python, and some simple NLP.  Create dataframes that can be read into Elasticsearch.
* Elasticsearch demo and examples in another notebook, using saved df's.
* Web demo using the elasticsearch-js library.

All of them assume localhost usage.  Also, online slides to go with: http://ghostweather.slides.com/lynncherny/deck-6.
